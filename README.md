# HR EMPLOYEE ATTRITION EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS- MY SQL

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Employee attrition refers to the process where employees leave a company through various means, such as voluntary resignations, layoffs, failure to return from a leave of absence, illness, or death. In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of employee attrition within a company by querying a dataset using SQL. I initiated the project by developing a hypothetical scenario where I assume the role of a data analyst within the company.

### CASE SITUATION


Imagine you are a data analyst working at a company. The companyâ€™s manager provides you with an HR Employee Attrition CSV dataset and assigns several tasks to derive insights from the data. The company pays the employees in dollars.

#### Tasks:
1.	Determine the total number of employees in the dataset.
2.	Calculate the average age of employees.
3.	Identify the number of employees in each department.
4.	Compute the average monthly income for employees by department.
5.	Count the number of employees who have left the company (attrition).
6.	Compare the average years at the company for employees who have left versus those who have stayed.
7.	Analyze the distribution of employees by job role.
8.	Identify the highest and lowest salaries in the dataset.
9.	Count the number of employees with more than 5 years of experience at the company.
10.	Determine the gender distribution of employees in each department.
11.	Calculate the average distance from home for employees who have left the company.
12.	Count the number of employees in the highest performance rating category.
13.	Calculate the average years since the last promotion for employees who have left the company.
14.	Analyze how many employees work overtime and how this correlates with attrition.
15.	Compare the average number of companies worked at by employees who have left versus those who have stayed.
16.	Count the number of employees with a work-life balance rating of 1.
17.	Count the number of employees in each department who have received a promotion in the last 5 years.
